# Berlin Clock with elevated concepts

This is a companion repository to the [Embedding domain concepts in code article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/embedding-domain-concepts-in-code/).

Code should clearly reflect the problem it’s solving, and thus openly expose that problem’s domain. Embedding domain concepts in code requires thought and skill, and doesn't drop out automatically from TDD. 

The blog post discusses this, and references this repository as an example of elevating the concepts following an initial tdd solution to the Berlin Clock kata.
